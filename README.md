# Decay Chain Simulation: Mo-99 → Tc-99m

This project simulates a two-step radioactive decay chain (Mo-99 → Tc-99m → stable) using Monte Carlo sampling and compares it with the analytic Bateman solution.

### Features
- Monte Carlo decay event sampling
- Parent & daughter nuclide behaviour
- Analytic vs stochastic comparison
- Outputs high-resolution plot

### Files
- Mo99_Tc99m_decay_chain.ipynb — main notebook
- Mo99_Tc99m_decay_chain.png — generated output plot
